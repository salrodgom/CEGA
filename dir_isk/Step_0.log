 xTB Geometry Optimization
 -------------------------
 Geometry successfully optimized.
 WARNING! Change in topology detected!
 The topology change was seen in the initial geometry optimization.
 This could be an artifact of the chosen theory level (--gfn2).
 You can check the optimization trajectory in the "xtbopt.log" file.
 Try either of these options:

    A) Pre-optimize your input seperately with xtb and use the optimized
       structure as input for CREST. (Only recommended if structure is intact)

    B) Restart the same CREST call as before, but ignore the topology change
       by using the "--noreftopo" keyword. (May produce artifacts)

    C) Fix the initial input geometry by introducing bond length constraints
       or by using a method with fixed topology (GFN-FF).
